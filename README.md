# Credit-Card-Default-Analysis
Model to predict whether customer default on loan or not
The purpose of this project is to conduct quantitative analysis on credit card default risk by using 3 machine learning models with accessible customer data, instead of credit score or credit history, with the goal of assisting and speeding up the human decision making process.
# Project Overview
The analysis consists of 2 Jupyter notebooks.

Exploratory Data Analysis. The detailed notebook of EDA can be found here.
Machine Learning Modeling. The detailed notebook of modeling can be found here.
Machine Learning Models Used:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest
XGBoost
